# When did

When did I come up with this idea? Wouldn't it be nice to know?

## The Idea

Imagine a simple app where you can start and name a timer, essentially a stop watch, that never stops. There literally is no stop functionality anywhere.

I might add timers for: When did...

`insert gif of adding the following timers`

* I graduate from college?
* I quit smoking?
* Adalyn take her first step?

The app would tell me in whichever units I desire.

`insert gif of cycling through units`

* decades
* years
* months
* weeks
* days
* hours
* minutes
* seconds
* any combination of the above

Examples:

* 11 years ago
* 3 months ago
* 3 days, 9 hours, 4 minutes, and 23 seconds ago

## First Steps

I went ahead and [started building an mvp on iOS](https://github.com/whendid/ios-app).

## Next Steps

See https://github.com/whendid/ios-app/issues

## Wait, the project is public?

In addition to posting the idea here in the open, for anyone to see and/or use, I'm also going to do the development of the app and any supporting software in the open. Until I find a better name for the app everything will be located at https://github.com/whendid
