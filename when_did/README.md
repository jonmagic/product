# When did

When did I come up with this idea? Wouldn't it be nice to know?

## The Idea

Imagine a simple app where you can start and name a timer, essentially a stop watch, that never stops. There literally is no stop functionality anywhere.

I might add timers for: When did...

`insert gif of adding the following timers`

* I graduate from college?
* I quit smoking?
* Adalyn take her first step?

The app would tell me in whichever units I desire.

* decades
* years
* months
* weeks
* days
* hours
* minutes
* seconds
* any combination of the above

## First Steps

I went ahead and [started building an mvp on iOS](https://github.com/whendid/ios-app).

## Next Steps

* Add ability to see time in other units (months, weeks, days, etc)
* Sync timers (currently stored in CoreData) either via Dropbox or iCloud
* Add server option ($5 per year) that backs up your timers and optionally send you anniversary reminder emails
