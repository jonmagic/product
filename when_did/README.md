# When did

When did I come up with this idea? Wouldn't it be nice to know?

## The Idea

Imagine a simple app where you can start and name a timer, essentially a stop watch, that never stops. There literally is no stop functionality anywhere.

I might add timers for: When did...

* I graduate from college?
* I quit smoking?
* Adalyn take her first step?

Then the app tells me how much time has passed.

## First Steps

I went ahead and [started building an mvp on iOS](https://github.com/whendid/ios-app).

## Next Steps

See https://github.com/whendid/ios-app/issues

## Wait, the project is public?

In addition to posting the idea here in the open, for anyone to see and/or use, I'm also going to do the development of the app and any supporting software in the open. Until I find a better name for the app everything will be located at https://github.com/whendid
